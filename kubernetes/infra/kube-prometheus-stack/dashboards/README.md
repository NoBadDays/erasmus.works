# Grafana Dashboards

These dashboards are provisioned into Grafana through the existing `ConfigMap` + sidecar pattern in this directory.

## Source

The following files are provisioned from this directory. Most were imported from Grafana community dashboards and kept stock unless noted otherwise:

## Local tags

We add local Grafana tags to make imported and repo-managed dashboards easier to find:

- `custom`
  - Marks dashboards we intentionally manage from this repo
- `community`
  - Used for imported Grafana community dashboards

## Notes

- Community dashboards may still need small datasource or query adjustments depending on metric labels in this cluster.
- If updating an imported dashboard, prefer replacing it from the upstream Grafana export first, then reapplying local tags if needed.
