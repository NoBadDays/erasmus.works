# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository manages my personal homelab Kubernetes cluster.

The goal is to keep the setup simple, reproducible, and low-maintenance.
Prefer incremental improvements over large rewrites.

## Current state

Currently in place:

- Talos Linux
- Single-node Kubernetes cluster
- Argo CD
- MetalLB
- Envoy Gateway
- Cloudflare Tunnel
- External Secrets Operator
- GitOps structure under `kubernetes/`

Not yet installed:

- external-dns
- Longhorn
- Postgres operator
- kube-prometheus-stack

Do not assume planned components are already installed.
Cloudflare may still be used as the external DNS provider even when the
`external-dns` Kubernetes controller is not installed.

## Principles

- Keep it KISS
- Prefer low-maintenance solutions
- Do not add tools unless clearly needed
- Prefer GitOps-managed changes where appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction
- Avoid premature HA or production-style complexity
- Preserve working setup unless a change is clearly required

## Repo structure

- `talos/` contains Talos machine configs and node-specific files
- `kubernetes/` contains GitOps-managed Kubernetes manifests
- `docs/` contains practical runbooks and setup notes
- `linux/` contains local workstation/helper setup files

## Change rules

When making changes:

1. Inspect the existing structure first
2. Reuse existing folders and patterns where possible
3. Keep changes minimal and obvious
4. Do not rename or move files unless there is a clear benefit
5. Do not add new tooling like Terraform, Flux, Helmfile, Ansible, or scripts unless explicitly requested
6. Do not introduce unnecessary docs
7. Do not claim something is installed unless it is already in the repo or explicitly being added now

## Kubernetes / GitOps rules

- Argo CD is the GitOps controller
- `kubernetes/clusters/homelab/homelab-root.yaml` is the root application entrypoint
- Infra components should live under `kubernetes/infra/`
- Keep manifests plain and readable
- Prefer simple manifests and Kustomize where possible
- Helm is already used through Argo CD Applications where explicitly added

## Documentation rules

- Root `README.md` should stay short and act as a project overview
- Command-heavy instructions belong in docs, not in the root README
- Add short practical notes rather than large architecture essays
- Avoid creating new docs unless there is a real need

## Naming guidance

- Use clear, literal names
- Match filenames to actual contents
- Avoid vague names like `stuff.yaml`, `test2.yaml`, `misc.md`
- Prefer consistency over cleverness

## If unsure

Prefer the simpler option.
Do not overengineer.
