# VolSync Restic Notes

## Scope

This note covers the repo-side VolSync setup for scheduled filesystem backups to the TrueNAS NFS share.

This setup is intentionally simple:

- live app data stays on Longhorn
- VolSync runs once per day
- Restic stores backup snapshots on the NFS share
- PostgreSQL backups are handled separately

## Current Settings

NFS export:

```text
192.168.20.40:/mnt/tank/k8s-volsync
```

Current backup PVCs:

```text
app-docmost/volsync-repository
apps/volsync-repository
500Gi each
```

Backup schedule:

```text
03:00  docmost-postgres CNPG backup
03:00  docmost-data VolSync
03:15  nextcloud-postgres CNPG backup
03:15  nextcloud-html VolSync
```

The backups are grouped by app where needed, while still staggering apps to
reduce I/O contention on the current 2-node Longhorn and SSD setup.

Restic retention:

- `daily: 7`
- `weekly: 4`
- `monthly: 3`
- `pruneIntervalDays: 7`

This keeps short-term recovery points without writing to the NAS all day.

## External Secret Refresh

The generated Kubernetes secret is refreshed from Bitwarden every `24h`.

That refresh interval:

- does not trigger backups
- does not write to the NAS
- only controls how often External Secrets checks Bitwarden for password changes

## First Workload

The first protected PVC is `docmost-data`.

The Restic repository path for it is:

```text
/mnt/repo/docmost-data
```

Future app backups should reuse the same pattern:

- one shared Bitwarden secret: `volsync-restic-password`
- one app-specific `ExternalSecret`
- one `ReplicationSource`
- one namespace-local `volsync-repository` PVC for any app that has been split out
- the same retention unless there is a reason to differ
- keep a given app's related backup window together when needed
- stagger different apps instead of piling every workload onto `03:00`
- a different PVC name and repository path

## Notes

- The NFS path in the PV must match the exported path shown by `showmount -e 192.168.20.40`.
- VolSync is for app PVC backups here, not PostgreSQL.
- The shared Restic password comes from the Bitwarden secret `volsync-restic-password`.
- If that password is rotated, reduce the refresh interval temporarily or force an External Secrets sync.
